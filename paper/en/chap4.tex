\chapter{Ontology}

\paragraph{}
In order to represent the source data in a structured manner intended for further processing we had to design a data model.
We chose to abstract the individual crimes and their perpetrators as observations of a statistical dataset. Therefore we would use
the standard W3C Data Cube vocabulary.
There were several reasons why representing the data in a statistical dataset was suitable.
TODO: reasons
\begin{itemize}
	\item reason a
	\item reason b
\end{itemize}

We identified the total of three distinct logical datasets in the source data.
One of them we would use to hold the crime records, one would be dedicated to hold the
perpetrators records and the third one would be a RDF linkset represented as a Data Cube dataset.
